#Step to setup citadel (simple smtp server):

#Install the dependency
sudo apt-get install zlib1g-dev
sudo apt-get install gettext

#Use easy install to install
sudo su
curl http://easyinstall.citadel.org/install | sh

#Create a username astrospace in the local citadel
#  username: astrospace
#  password: passw0rd


#Change the current ./app/config/mail.php 
# Switch from current implementation (gmail) to new implementation which is commented (use citadel) 

#Change the model ./app/models/User.php
# Relax the restriction on email format (since the local smtp domain is student-laptop, it violate the rules imposed by laravel)
# We just need to switch the commented part on rules


#If you got difficulty, just ask me. Michael
